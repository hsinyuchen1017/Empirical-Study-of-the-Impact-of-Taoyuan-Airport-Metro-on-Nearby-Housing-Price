# Empirical-Study-of-the-Impact-of-Taoyuan-Airport-Metro-on-Nearby-Housing-Price
In this project, I applied Hedonic Price Model to analyze real estate transaction data and Difference-in-Differences Method to estimate the impact of new metro operation on nearby housing price by Stata.

The program performs the following processes:
- Used R to crawl housing price data from the internet and arrange them in order with VBA.
- Created models to regress housing price effect with Difference-in-Differences estimation.
- Tested the statistical significance of independent variables in the regression and visualized the study results by Stata.
